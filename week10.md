# Week 10: Knowledge and Skills Assessment Insights

### Overview of KSA Self-Assessment Results

In Week 10, we analyzed and assessed what we know and what we know how to do (KSA) in the areas of computer networking, cybersecurity and system administration. Each KSA has been given an evaluation scale from 'No knowledge or skills' to 'Good knowledge or skills.' Self assessment results of this week tells me where I stand regarding the understanding and competencies and points for improvements.

### Knowledge Assessment Breakdown

#### Areas of Strong Knowledge:
- **Computer Networking & Protocols (K0001, K0011, K0019, K0061)**:  I showed good grasp with network protocols, network infrastructure and crypto concepts. It refers to the knowledge of encryption algorithm (K0018) and cryptographic key management (K0019), network key protocols such as TCP/IP, OSI model etc.
  
- **Cybersecurity & Privacy Principles (K0049, K0050, K0038)**:  A good understanding of the concept of network security, with proper grip on the methods of firewall management, encryption methods and confidentiality/integrity standards. I also know quite a bit about the privacy regulations pertaining to data protection.

- **Systems & Network Security (K0075, K0167, K0275)**:  I have some knowledge of risk management processes and how symmetric key rotation should be done, and I want to further enforce the assessment and reduction of risks.

#### Areas Needing Improvement:
- **Risk Management (K0002, K0201)**: While I possess some knowledge in risk management processes and symmetric key rotation techniques, there is a need to improve in methods for assessing and mitigating risks.
  
- **Network Troubleshooting & Management (S0041, S0033)**:  Some knowledge in configuring and troubleshooting LAN/WAN components, and diagnosis of network connectivity issues. Although, some practice and working on these skills will increase my troubleshooting efficiency and capacity to solve problems on the real world.

- **Security Design & Evaluation (S0031, S0040)**:  While Iâ€™m experienced in access control design, I need to improve further on the adequate of security design evaluation for systems in order to address the ability to assess them.

#### New Skills and Concepts:
- **Understanding Emerging Technologies (K0332, K0285, K0130)**: This week I focused on adding to my knowledge on what is going on with new technologies like embedded systems and integrating virtual private network (VPN) security. That helps me gain a better sense of how systems interact with new hardware and software components.


Week 10 has been an informative week in regards of evaluating my prowess in different subdomains. I have a good handle on core networking and security principals, however, there are some needed improvement on things. To become better proficient in these key aspects of IT and cybersecurity, I want to improve focus on exploring risk management, security design, and network troubleshooting.
