# Week 01 - Cryptography Journal

## Topic Overview
In the course of this week, I tackled the **Caesar Cipher**, one of the simplest and yet most popular branch of encryption techniques. The method shifts each plaintext letter a predetermined number of positions to lower alphabetical positions. This encryption method grants basic protection which seems insufficient compared to current security measures yet it supports fundamental concepts of historic cryptography systems.
## Insights and Reflections
While letter shifting did not seem like the most complex concept to grasp, I had a hard time figuring out how to implement this cipher in code. Writing a functionaly implementation will be possible using a similar algorithm, but by breaking the algorithm step by step and apply it to both the lowercase and the uppercase letters. Along with that I learnt the limitations of the Caesar Cipher, it is not immune to **Brute force attacks** there which means only 25 possible shifts.
## Code Implementation: nano caesar_cipher.py
Here is my implementation of the Caesar Cipher in Python:

def caesar_cipher(text, shift, encrypt=True):
    result = ""
    for char in text:
        if char.isalpha():
            shift_amount = shift if encrypt else -shift
            new_char = chr(((ord(char.lower()) - 97 + shift_amount) % 26) + 97)
            result += new_char.upper() if char.isupper() else new_char
        else:
            result += char
    return result

## Example Usage
plain_text = input("Enter your message: ")
shift_value = int(input("Enter shift value (1-25): "))
cipher_text = caesar_cipher(plain_text, shift_value)
print("Encrypted Message:", cipher_text)
print("Decrypted Message:", caesar_cipher(cipher_text, shift_value, encrypt=False))

## Code Output
Enter your message: My First Journal
Enter shift value (1-25): 5
Encrypted Message: Rd Knwxy Ozwsfqi
Decrypted Message: My First Journal

## Comparisons and Observations
The Caesar Cipher is incredibly insecure compared to modern ciphers such as AES or RSA. However, this is helpful in developing an understanding of notions such as substitution ciphers and modular arithmetic. However, its simplicity makes it suitable for educating (what encryption is really about) and perhaps for explaining how encryption works.
## Challenges and Solutions
Initially, since I tried to pass the empty value to int(), I got a ValueError. To resolve it, I enclosed it in a try â€“ except and checked the type of entered value was an int before using the methods.
